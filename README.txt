Kahindu - Image Processing in Java

While you should all be able to find suitable images to test the system, I have provided some in the GIFS folder.

The source code is in the SRC folder.

Kahindu is an image processing application developed in Java at Fairfield University by a team lead by Douglas Lyon. He used it as the case study for his book on Java coding, Java for Programmers.  It will serve as the subject of the assignments throughout this course. Load it into whichever development environment you prefer – I recommend Eclipse (www.eclipse.org).

The on-line resources for the book that this code base supported are available at http://www.DocJava.com
